#  Telangana State Weather Data Analysis (Power BI)

##  Project Overview
Weather conditions play a critical role in agriculture, water resource management, disaster preparedness, public health, and infrastructure planning.  
This project analyzes historical weather data of Telangana using Power BI to transform large, multi-dimensional datasets into clear, actionable insights at district and mandal levels.

The dashboard integrates rainfall, temperature, humidity, and wind speed metrics to identify seasonal patterns, long-term trends, extreme events, and anomalies for data-driven decision-making.

---

##  Objectives
- Analyze district-wise and mandal-wise weather behavior  
- Identify seasonal and yearly trends in key weather metrics  
- Detect extreme weather events and anomalies  
- Compare weather patterns across districts  
- Support planning and climate risk mitigation

##  Dashboard Visuals
- KPI Cards for key weather metrics  
- Matrix table with district-wise comparison and conditional formatting  
- Seasonal clustered column charts  
- Year-wise trend line charts  
- Filled map for district-level seasonal patterns  

(Visuals optimized to 4–5 key charts for clarity and impact)

---

##  Key Insights
- Rainfall is highly monsoon-dependent, with ~80% occurring between June–September  
- Strong seasonal consistency enables predictable planning  
- Significant district and mandal-level variability (>60%)  
- Gradual warming trend observed from 2021–2024  
- High temperature and humidity often occur together, increasing health risks  
- Extreme weather events show seasonal clustering  

---

##  Conclusions
- Telangana exhibits strong seasonal weather predictability  
- Localized (mandal-level) analysis is essential due to high variability  
- Rising heat stress indicates increasing climate risk  
- Weather parameters are interdependent and must be analyzed together  

---

##  Recommendations
- District- and mandal-specific agriculture and water planning  
- Heat-stress alerts and humidity–health monitoring dashboards  
- Weather-resilient infrastructure in high-risk districts  
- Real-time monitoring and decision support using Power BI
